An operating system provides the environment within which programs are
executed. Internally, operating systems vary greatly in their makeup, since
they are organized along many different lines. The design of a new operating
system is a major task. It is important that the goals of the system be well
defined before the design begins. These goals form the basis for choices among
various algorithms and strategies.
We can view an operating system from several vantage points. One view
focuses on the services that the system provides; another, on the interface that
it makes available to users and programmers; a third, on its components and
their interconnections. In this chapter, we explore all three aspects of operating
systems, showin.g the viewpoints of users, programmers, and operating-system
designers. We consider what services an operating system provides, how
they are provided, how they are debugged, and what the various method-
ologies are for designing such systems. Finally, we describe how op
